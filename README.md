# synthrise-ethers
A simple and beautiful tool to send your ethers :D

Testing my web3.0 skills, I developed a tool that sends and receives ethers, connecting its #metamask . 🤖⚡️
But you may ask me: ''But Victor, I can do this directly from my Metamask, why would I use your website?'' 🤔
And I answer: You can use your own #metamask , but my website is infinitely more beautiful! And it's a tool made for the ''Synthrise Corporation'' 
that will soon be a #dao ! You can be one of the first to test this tool that will probably receive countless other features! 🤣 



Features:



✅ It is a web 3.0 application with Next JS 

✅ #SmartContract using #Solidity

✅ Beautifully styled using Tailwind CSS

✅ Web 3.0 authentication using MetaMask

✅ Send and receive functionality for your tokens on blockchain with Solidity

✅ Storage of data and information about each transaction on Sanity.io

✅ Used GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries) to retrieve data from Sanity Studio and display it on the screen.
